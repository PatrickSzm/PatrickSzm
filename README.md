## 🧠 About Me

I'm a highly motivated and ambitious computer science student, driven by curiosity and the thrill of building software that matters. I thrive in collaborative environments, adapt quickly to new challenges, and constantly seek to improve both my technical and soft skills.

Whether it's working on full-stack applications, designing compilers, or experimenting with game development, I always aim to understand the “why” behind the technology and create clean, scalable solutions.
